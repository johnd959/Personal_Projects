                Breaststroke is a swimming style in which the swimmer is on 
                their chest and the torso does not rotate. It is the most 
                popular recreational style due to the swimmer's head being 
                out of the water a large portion of the time, and that it 
                can be swum comfortably at slow speeds. In most swimming 
                classes, beginners learn either the breaststroke or the freestyle (front crawl) 
                first. However, at the competitive level, swimming breaststroke at speed requires 
                endurance and strength comparable to other strokes. Some people refer to breaststroke 
                as the "frog" stroke, as the arms and legs move somewhat like a frog swimming in the water. 
                The stroke itself is the slowest of any competitive strokes and is thought to be the oldest 
                of all swimming strokes.
